# Session 2: data science workflow

## Setup

To run this notebook, you'll need to install (via `conda` or `pip`):

* `matplotlib`
* `pandas`
* `sklearn`

Additionally, you will need to obtain the data for yourself. The Titanic
dataset has no clearly-indicated license attached to it, which means that
publicly reposting it here could possibly violate some copyright or another.
It's easily available, though, through Kaggle itself.
